Manhole Covers,manhole,"Manhole covers are one point of entry into the city's underground world, and their designs indicate what part of that world they connect to. Here are some manhole covers that might help you identify pieces of the internet. "
Street Markings,streetmarking,"Sometimes you'll see a manhole cover that is surrounded with colorful markings. Whenever a contractor or construction company plans to do street excavation, utility companies will mark out the location of their underground cables so that the contractor knows to watch out for them.

There's a federal color-code standard for sidewalk markings. New York follows that standard.

Orange refers to the broad catch-all of ""Communications, alarm, signal lines, cables and conduit."" This means that orange lines can be internet cables, television cables, telephone lines, or other kinds of conduits. 

The markings are sometimes really sloppy, and often in fragments. Sometimes you'll see several different labels in the same place. A lot of these cables are bundled up together running through ducts under the city. "
Various Antennas,antennas,"Tracking things on the ground can sometimes be tricky--markings and manhole covers get worn down and faded, they're sometimes in the middle of the road, and it's easy to bump into things when looking down all the time. Here are some other objects that indicate pieces of the network. "
Cameras,cameras,"Admittedly, much of this guide has focused on seeing internet-connected networks in the field--networks that, for the most part, the reader has access to. But the city is also full of networked objects that, while often serving a public interest, aren't connected to public networks. These sensors vary from monitoring vehicular traffic to recording water usage. Surveillance cameras are perhaps one of the more noticeable--and contested--forms of networked objects in public space. The public ""connects"" to surveillance networks all the time, albeit involuntarily, and this section offers a view into who controls some of the ubiquitous networks.

Sightseeing,places,"There are a few well-known locations that people tend to go to when they want to ""see the internet"" in New York. Of course, there are plenty of not-so-famous buildings in Manhattan that store lots of data and connect networks to each other. Identifying these buildings when looking on the street is not always easy, but one telltale sign is to look for signs of ventilation and cooling systems. Alternatively, look for windows, or more accurately, the absence of them. (Note: on much larger buildings, in particular skyscrapers, vents also could just be a sign of a mechanical floor, the centralized space dedicated to maintaining utility needs for the entire building.)

New infrastructures have a tendency to inherit the homes of past infrastructures, and the internet is no exception. Many of the major internet exchanges and data centers of Manhattan are in buildings that used to be telegraph switches, telephone company headquarters, and other industrial spaces. While this is by no means an exhaustive list, these are a few interesting starting points from which you can start looking for cable markings, cameras, or other signs of internet infrastructure. "
